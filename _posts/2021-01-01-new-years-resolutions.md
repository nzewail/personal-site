One of the things that I am going to try and do more of in 2021 is just write more. I don't really have a specific category of thing that I want to write about (will probably be a mix of sports, politics, tech, and just random thoughts), but my goals are simply to be more aritculate in my thoughts and document them in a more regular way. I feel that I often just have an idea in my head will talk through it in the shower or walking around the house and it will just die into the ether. By writing it down, I get the chance to to more formalize those thoughts.

As for this post, I don't really have anything specific that I want to write about but thought I'd share my new year's resolutions:

1. Read less about American and more about the world - felt like this year I was consuming a lot of information about really esoteric American-centric topics and
focused less on global issues so want to get back to reading more about global issues
2. Consume less content in general - I really shouldn't have a podcast in my ear all hours of the day
3. Plant a vegetable
4. Write more 

Let's hope for more adventures in 2021!
